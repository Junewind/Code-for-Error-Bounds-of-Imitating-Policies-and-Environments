# Error Bounds of Imitating Policies and Environments

This is the repository hosting the code used for our NeurIPS 2020 paper: Error Bounds of Imitating Policies and Environments. The code contains the implementation of the BC, GAIL, DAgger, FEM, MWAL, MBRL_BC, MBRL_GAIL.

## Requirements

We use Python 3.6 to run all experiments. Please install MuJoCo following the instructions from [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py). Other python packages are listed in [requirement.txt](requirement.txt)

## Dataset

Dataset, including expert demonstrations and expert policies (parameters), is provided in the folder of [dataset](dataset).

However, one can run SAC to re-train expert policies (see [scripts/run_sac.sh](scripts/run_sac.sh)) and to collect expert demonstrations (see [scripts/run_collect.sh](scripts/run_collect.sh)).

## Usage

The folder of [scripts](scripts) provides all demo running scripts to test algorithms like GAIL, BC, DAgger, FEM, GTAL, and imitating-environments algorithms.
